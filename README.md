# Molecular Dynamics Simulator
A basic simulation for molecular dynamics, a UG Project

This project presents a Molecular Dynamics Simulator built from scratch in Python to model the motion and interaction of particles within a confined box. It leverages NumPy for efficient numerical computations and Matplotlib, PyGame for visualization. The simulator incorporates spring-based pairwise forces, wall reflections, and both basic and energy-conserving integration schemes to update particle positions and velocities over time. Through comparisons of different integration methods and simulation scales, it demonstrates key physical principles such as Newtonâ€™s laws, energy conservation, and emergent collective behavior in dynamic systems. Additionally, the simulator includes special functions to handle cases such as inelastic collisions, periodic boundaries, and more, exploring a variety of physical scenarios and system behaviors.

Out of the simulations, we are able to find some meaningfull and real life observations

Thank you!
